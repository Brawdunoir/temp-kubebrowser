#  What is Kubebrowserâ€¯?

Kubebrowser simplifies Kubernetes access management by providing a centralized catalog where users can easily generate their own Kubeconfigs using OpenID Connect (OIDC). Designed for organizations using multiple cloud providers and/or self-managed Kubernetes clusters, Kubebrowser reduces the complexity of Kubeconfig supply to your end users.

## Use case

Whenever you have *self-hosted* or *managed* Kubernetes clusters on cloud provider with weak IAM (e.g. [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)) it becomes hard to control who has access to what.

Kubebrowser let you leverage the [Kubernetes API server OIDC configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) and solves the *how* to give people (developers, testers, admins, etc.) individual Kubeconfig.

Using Kubebrowser, administrators manage a list of clusters and, if needed, a whitelist of *who* should have access to such cluster. Note that Kubebrowser only offers a way to **distribute** Kubeconfigs (used to *authenticate* to clusters). *Authorization* still relies on native Kubernetes RBAC.

Other ways to manage such *authentication* could be to install [permission manager](https://github.com/sighupio/permission-manager) or [pinniped](https://pinniped.dev/), however, for mid-size businesses, the first one can be limiting, and the latter could be challenging to operate.
