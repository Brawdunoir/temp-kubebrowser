## Local setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A local Kubernetes cluster running, we recommend [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) and [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) CLI.
- An OpenID provider.
  - Could be any provider, like a local [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/oidc-layers) or even [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect).
- Golang, NodeJS with pnpm and Skaffold.
  - *Optional* We are using [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/) to easily create isolated shells for development. Simply run `devbox shell` after installing `devbox`.
  - Otherwise you can manually install the right versions listed in the `devbox.json` file.
- *Optional* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) as its hooks are checked by the pipeline.
- *Optional* [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

### Run Kubebrowser locally

Set up your environment
1. Create a new OIDC application following your provider's documentation (you can set the redirect address to `http://localhost:8080`).
1. Copy the `.envrc_example` to a new file named `.envrc`.
1. Update `client_id`, `client_secret` and `issuer_url` in your `.envrc` (from your OIDC application in step 1).
1. Run `source .envrc` or run `direnv allow` if you have installed [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
1. Make sure your cluster is running and your context is correct. Run `minikube start` if you're using minikube.
1. Run `skaffold dev`.
1. Access http://localhost:8080.
